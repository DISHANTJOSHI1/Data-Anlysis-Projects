# Data-Anlysis-Projects
This are the projects that I completed for the subject Introduction to Data Science in my first semester of master's program.

project 1 is based on dataset of Baltimore public salary information compiled by Baltimore Sun Media Group for the year 2017.
In this project I will try to analyze and visualize the dataset using python libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and seaborn and get useful insight to draw some conclusions out of it.
This dataset has 16 columns 127840 rows and 12.9 MB in size.
Major columns to fucus on are salaries, organizations, overtime and pay rate. 
The link for the dataset is: https://www.baltimoresun.com/data/bal-public-salaries-archive-20150415-htmlstory.html

Project 2, “Terror Attacks in India” dataset which is available on data.world extracted from Global terror dataset.
Link for Dataset is: https://data.world/prapull/terror-attacks-in-india
It has 9,940 rows and 16 columns with 1021.76 KB of size.
Hypothesis:
  a.	Weapons that caused most of the casualties
  b.	To find if there is a trend in terror attacks based on the month.
  c.	If the target place and weapons used have any relation.

Dataset 3 https://www.kaggle.com/alifarukyucel/minimum-wage-by-state/data (2751,9) with 170 KB 
Hypothesis: if US elections has any impact or relation with the unemployment rate and minimum wages in the country.
